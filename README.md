# coffee-roaster-software with Arduino
This is for a DiY Drum coffe raoster.

The project I want to make  is beginning with a very simple structure of Software and Hardware.
It is a PID control Temp of a grill ( rotisserie), that I have transformed it into a basic coffe-roaster.
It has a metal mesh drum, which is rotated by a 220VAC electric motor (15rot/min) 
The heat is provided by 4 reistences, two of 600W, constant values, and two variable resistences, 600W each, controled by a SSR connected at a PWM output of the Arduino.

The temperature is measured with a K type thermocouple, and a Max6675 shield connected at a analog input of the Arduino.

I have only one sensor for the moment, just for the IT (internal temp), but it will be a BT( bean temperature) in  the future too. 
No forced ventilation for the moment, but it will be.
The electric motor will be a variable speed controled
